# Next-Word-Prediction-Project-LSTM
This project implements a next word prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The goal is to predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding words. The model is trained using supervised machine learning on a dataset of text.
Features
LSTM Model: Utilizes the power of LSTM networks for capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data.
Supervised Learning: Trains the model in a supervised manner, where input sequences are paired with their corresponding target words.
Word Embeddings: Employs word embeddings to represent words in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships.
